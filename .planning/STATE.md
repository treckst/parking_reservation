# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-10)

**Core value:** Customers can request a valid parking reservation through conversation, with accurate availability, no overlapping bookings, administrator approval, and no disclosure of other customers' personal details.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Persistent Grounded Policy Chat; ready for discussion and planning.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Persistent Grounded Policy Chat)
Plan: None — phase plans TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Roadmap: APPROVED by the user on 2026-11-10
Last activity: 2026-11-10 — User approved the four-phase Vertical MVP roadmap; project initialization complete with all 49 requirements mapped and no implementation completed.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decisions are recorded in PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.

- All 49 v1 requirements, Vertical MVP delivery, and the four-phase roadmap are user-approved.
- Four working slices: policy chat → SQL availability/grid → pending requests → admin decisions/cancellation.
- Build/start the Agent Server image before FastAPI SDK chat integration; verify prerequisites in Phase 1.
- Preserve SQLite records; migrations and transactional booking correctness precede customer writes.
- Local trusted demo only; no accounts/API keys, public deployment, payments, automatic expiry, extra agent frameworks, or model substitution.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 gates: exact model/account access, Agent Server entitlement/dependencies, NumPy/Chroma imports, preserved embedding compatibility, session lifetime/new chat, query identity and same-thread contention.
- Phase 2 gates: interval/timezone/demo-clock semantics, legacy blocking statuses, type matching, grid period/status/refresh policy, and preserving migration.
- Phase 3 gates: plate normalization, zone/slot selection, booking ownership, durable replay identity, and atomic two-process SQLite conflict/retry checks before writes.
- Phase 4 gates: ownerless fixture cancellation, administrator repeat/race semantics, status reconciliation, cross-tab refresh, and shared-container SQLite recovery.
- Unresolved policies are explicit gates, not chosen defaults; skipped configured live checks remain unverified.
